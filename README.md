shorter and simpler but still FLAT PAGE crap is not factored out.

a perfect specimen / example of a totally fucked up "demo" of web shit so crappy, that even the OP cannot maintain his own crap. so lousy and pathetic.

wanna read an abysmal description? here: "Frozen-Flask freezes a Flask application into a set of static files. The result can be hosted without any server-side software other than a traditional web server."

tells you bloody nothing at all.

here is a guy with non existing command of the English language: "Frozen-Flask is only about deployment: instead of installing Python, a WGSI server and Flask on your server, you can use Frozen-Flask to freeze your application and only have static HTML files on your server."

We all knew that web people are very stupid and unfit to do real computer work.
